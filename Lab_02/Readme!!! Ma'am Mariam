the folder with apk of task2 and its main folder is in task2 final, please kindly ignore the other task2 folder, because its not
working and full of exceptions.
As for task2, the app i have created for task2 does not contain images/names/rollnumber etc of people in our groups because by the
time i created it, group members were not fully confirmed. but let me assure you that the functionality of the app is programmed 
as required.

Thank you.

Neel
